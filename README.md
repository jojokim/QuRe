## Inspiration
### As college students and members of a generation that was raised on technology, we are in many ways dependent on the Internet. We need our Internet to function well so we can complete schoolwork, which has been integrated into the Internet, as well as consume entertainment. The Internet isn’t just part of our lives — it’s key in a medical emergency. A patient’s health records can make a huge difference treatment outcomes. Emergency responders need to know about a patient’s preexisting medical conditions and drug allergies to effectively treat them. However, EMT’s may not have the time or technology access to a lightning fast Internet connection to access those records. It would be particularly problematic when dealing with unconscious or severely impaired patients. We often see QR codes used as promotional material — a fast and easy way to get someone to look at a website. But at their core, QR codes are a method of storing information that is easily accessible. We believe that for all the convenience that the Internet provides, it should not make a difference in the quality of emergency care.

## What it does
### QuRe is a tool utilized to improve response time speed for emergency personnel. With a simple scan, a QuRe tattoo gives access to a plethora of detailed patient information to be referenced at a moment’s notice during an emergency.
